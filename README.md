Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. Artemis Financial develops individualized financial plans for their customers that include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize their company with the most current and effective software security.

I did very well identifying the security vulnerabilities within the code. It is important to consider security threats at every level in the software development life cycle. There are several areas of security I will focus on as the developer. Regarding the first layer of the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram, at a minimum, I would implement the following security measures: Input validation, APIs, Cryptography, and Code quality. 

The part of the vulnerability assessment that was challenging for me was using HTTPS. The most helpful part of the vulnerability assessment was running the dependency check. 

To increase layers of security, I would impose input authentication and validation. I would also use HTTP post for secure communication. 

After refactoring the code, I ran the dependency check again. I made sure to hide false positives before running the check again. 

I used several different resources that might be helpful in future assignments. I found helpful articles on the web, helpful videos on YouTube, and re-read chapters to gain a better understanding of concepts. 

I might show future employers how well I can run a dependency check.
